Window Sizer makes it a snap to size Windows application windows ready
for screenshots. Once you've built WNDSZR.EXE (it compiles with Delphi
XE3 but earlier (and later) versions will work), run it, use the
scrolls bars to set the window size, switch to the application and hit
SHIFT+CTRL+A. The application window is resized and snapped to the
centre of the main desktop window.
